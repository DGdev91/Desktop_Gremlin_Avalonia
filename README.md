Forked from [KurtValesco's Desktop Gremlin](https://github.com/KurtVelasco/Desktop_Gremlin), this version uses Avalonia instead WPF and LibVLC for audio, so it can run also on Linux and Mac

A fun little .Net application that displays an animated interactive character on your desktop.

# Characters
This project has initially been forked from Desktop Gremlin 2.8 and contains the sprites and sounds for MatikaneTannhäuser (Mambo) from UmaMusume, more characters can be found on [the original projects's page](https://github.com/KurtVelasco/Desktop_Gremlin).
You should be able to use sprites and sounds from a different character, as long as they follow the same format (old characters will likely not work)

# Linux
This project uses LibVLC to handle sounds. While on Windows and Mac it's already included, on Linux you need to have libVLC-dev installed on your system, if not already installed.

Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install libvlc-dev
```
Arch
```
sudo pacman -S libvlc
```
Fedora
```
dnf install vlc-libs
```
